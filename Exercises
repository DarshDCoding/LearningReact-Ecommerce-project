# Lession 6 Exercises
## 6a. In the checkout page, split up the header into a separate component called  CheckoutHeader.
    - Since CheckoutHeader is not shared (it's only used on the checkout page), save it in the pages folder insted of components folder.
    - Rename checkout-header.css to CheckoutHeader.css. Update the imports so each component imports the css file with the same name.
    //done...

## 6b. When there are multiple components for a page, we usually group them together into a folder.
    - Inside the pages folder, create a folder named checkout, and move all components and CSS related to the checkout page into this folder.
    - Update all your imports.
    //done...

## 6c. In CheckoutHeader replace all <a> element with <Link> components.
    //done...

## 6d. Save the changes form the previous exercises into git.
    - For the rest of the exercises, save changes into git after each exercise.
    //done...

## 6e. Rename header.css to Header.css so it matches the component's name. Chekcout the git section to see if git detected the change.
    - If git detected the change, save the change into git (using Commit).
    - If git did not detect the change, this happens because on some operating systems (Windows and Mac), git is case-insensitive. That means header.css and Header.css are considered the same.
    - To fix this, rename header.css to something like header2.css. Save these changes into git (using commit). Then, rename header2.css to Header.css and git will now detect the change.
    //done...

## 6f.  React Router has another component called <NavLink> that is useful for navigation links (links at the top of a page, usually in a header).
    - For an example, check apple.com and see the links at the top.
    - In Header.jsx, update all <Link>s to <NavLink>s (props are the same).
        //have done already.

    - The special feature of <NavLink> is it knows which page is loaded. For example, if you're on the Orders page, it adds a class called active to the Orders link (className="orders-link ... active").
    - Inside Header.css, style the orders link so when it's active, "Orders" is underlined (Hint: .orders-link.active will style an element with the class order-link and active. Use text-decoration:underline;)
    -Open the website, go to the orders page, and check the Orders link in the header.
    //done...
