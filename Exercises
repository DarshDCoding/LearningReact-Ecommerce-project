# Lession 6 Exercises
## 6a. In the checkout page, split up the header into a separate component called  CheckoutHeader.
    - Since CheckoutHeader is not shared (it's only used on the checkout page), save it in the pages folder insted of components folder.
    - Rename checkout-header.css to CheckoutHeader.css. Update the imports so each component imports the css file with the same name.
    //done...

## 6b. When there are multiple components for a page, we usually group them together into a folder.
    - Inside the pages folder, create a folder named checkout, and move all components and CSS related to the checkout page into this folder.
    - Update all your imports.
    //done...

## 6c. In CheckoutHeader replace all <a> element with <Link> components.
    //done...

## 6d. Save the changes form the previous exercises into git.
    - For the rest of the exercises, save changes into git after each exercise.
